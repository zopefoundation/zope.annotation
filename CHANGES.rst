 Changes
=========

5.0 (2023-03-27)
================

- Add support for Python 3.11.

- Drop support for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.


4.8 (2022-09-06)
================

- Add support for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.

- Drop support for Python 3.4.


4.7.0 (2018-10-16)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.7 and drop support for Python 3.3.

- Fix a DeprecationWarning from ``zope.annotation.attribute``. See
  `issue 16 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.annotation/issues/16>`_.

4.6.0 (2017-09-22)
==================

- Make ``AttributeAnnotations`` have a ``__parent__``. The
  ``__parent__`` is the object that it stores ``__annotations__`` on.
  This is a convenience for upwards traversal as used by things like
  ``zope.keyreference``. See
  https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.annotation/issues/11


4.5 (2017-06-03)
================

- Drop support for Python 2.6.

- Claim support for Python 3.5 and 3.6.

- Reach 100% test coverage.

- ``AttributeAnnotations`` is now always a
  ``collections.MutableMapping``. Previously on Python 2 it was a
  ``UserDict.DictMixin``.

4.4.1 (2015-01-09)
==================

- Convert doctests to Sphinx documentation.  Doctest snippets are still
  tested via ``tox -e docs``.


4.4.0 (2015-01-09)
==================

- LP #98462:  add additional "iterable mapping" methods to ``IAnnotations``.

- LP #878265:

  - Make ``persistent`` (used only for doctests) a soft dependency,
    installable via the ``zope.annotation[btree]`` extra.

  - Make ``BTrees`` (used for attribute storage) a soft dependency,
    installable via the ``zope.annotation[btree]`` extra.  Fall back to
    using ``dict`` for attribute storage if ``BTrees`` is not importable.

4.3.0 (2014-12-26)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.4.

4.2.0 (2013-03-18)
==================

- Don't make AttributeAnnotations available as a view.

4.1.0 (2013-02-24)
==================

- Add ``__bool__`` method to ``IAnnotations`` API for Python 3 compatibility.

4.0.1 (2013-02-11)
==================

- Add `tox.ini`.

4.0.0 (2013-02-11)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.3 and PyPy.

- Replace deprecated ``zope.component.adapts`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.component.adapter`` decorator.

- Replace deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Drop support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.

- Include zcml dependencies in configure.zcml, require the necessary packages
  via a zcml extra, added tests for zcml.

3.5.0 (2009-09-07)
==================

- Add ZODB3 to install_requires, because it's a true requirement of this
  package, not just a testing requirement, as BTrees are in use.

- Fix one test that was inactive because it's function was overriden by
  a mistake.

3.4.2 (2009-03-09)
==================

- Clean up package description and documentation a bit.

- Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

- Remove old zpkg-related files.

3.4.1 (2008-08-26)
==================

- Annotation factories take care not to store proxies in the database,
  so adapting an object wrapped in a ``LocationProxy`` works correctly.
  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/261620

3.4.0 (2007-08-29)
==================

- Annotation factories are no longer containing the factored object.
  Instead the objects are located using ``zope.location``. This removes
  a dependency to ``zope.app.container``.
