===========================
Changes for zope.annotation
===========================


==================
3.4.1 (unreleased)
==================

- Annotation factories take care not to store proxies in the database, so
  adapting an object wrapped in a LocationProxy works correctly.
  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/261620


==================
3.4.0 (2007-08-29)
==================

- Annotation factories are no longer containing the factored object.
  Instead the objects are located using zope.location .  This removes
  a dependency to zope.app.container .
