3.6.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.component.adapts`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.component.adapter`` decorator.

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.

- Included zcml dependencies in configure.zcml, require the necessary packages
  via a zcml extra, added tests for zcml.

3.5.0 (2009-09-07)
------------------

- Add ZODB3 to install_requires, because it's a true requirement of this
  package, not just a testing requirement, as BTrees are in use.

- Fix one test that was inactive because it's function was overriden by
  a mistake.

3.4.2 (2009-03-09)
------------------

- Clean up package description and documentation a bit.

- Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org, as
  zope3-dev at zope.org is now retired.

- Remove old zpkg-related files.

3.4.1 (2008-08-26)
------------------

- Annotation factories take care not to store proxies in the database,
  so adapting an object wrapped in a ``LocationProxy`` works correctly.
  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/261620

3.4.0 (2007-08-29)
------------------

- Annotation factories are no longer containing the factored object.
  Instead the objects are located using ``zope.location``. This removes
  a dependency to ``zope.app.container``.
